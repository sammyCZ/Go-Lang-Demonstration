# Linux
 Remove any previous Go installation by deleting the /usr/local/go folder (if it exists), then extract the archive you just downloaded into /usr/local, creating a fresh Go tree in /usr/local/go:

$ rm -rf /usr/local/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.27.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz
      
(You may need to run each command separately with the necessary permissions, as root or through sudo.)

Do not untar the archive into an existing /usr/local/go tree. This is known to produce broken Go installations.
Add /usr/local/go/bin to the PATH environment variable.

You can do this by adding the following line to your $HOME/.profile or /etc/profile (for a system-wide installation):

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
          
Note: Changes made to a profile file may not apply until the next time you log into your computer. To apply the changes immediately, just run the shell commands directly or execute them from the profile using a command such as source $HOME/.profile.
Add $HOME/go/bin (the default Go bin path) to your PATH environment variable to use tools installed via go install.

You can do this by adding the following line to your $HOME/.profile or $HOME/.bashrc file:

export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
          
Restart any open terminal sessions for the changes to take effect.

Verify that you've installed Go by opening a command prompt and typing the following command:

$ go version
          
Confirm that the command prints the installed version of Go.

# Mac 

Open the package file you downloaded and follow the prompts to install Go.

The package installs the Go distribution to /usr/local/go. The package adds the /usr/local/go/bin directory to your PATH environment variable by creating a /etc/paths.d/go file.
Add $HOME/go/bin (the default Go bin path) to your PATH environment variable to use tools installed via go install.

You can do this by adding the following line to your ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile file:

export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
          
Restart any open terminal sessions for the changes to take effect.

Verify that you've installed Go by opening a new terminal session and typing the following command:

$ go version
          
Confirm that the command prints the installed version of Go.

# Windows
 Open the MSI file you downloaded and follow the prompts to install Go.

By default, the installer will install Go to Program Files or Program Files (x86). You can change the location as needed. After installing, you will need to close and reopen any open command prompts so that changes to the environment made by the installer are reflected at the command prompt.
Verify that you've installed Go.

    In Windows, click the Start menu.
    In the menu's search box, type cmd, then press the Enter key.
    In the Command Prompt window that appears, type the following command:

     $ go version
                  
Confirm that the command prints the installed version of Go.
